    <h4>House Blend Coffee</h4>

    <p>
        House blend is a slippery term in coffee.
        It can suggest the straightforward and reliable, as in “house wine,”
        and it can mean something unusual but local, not to be had elsewhere,
        as in “only at our house.” Plus over the last decade it has taken on still another meaning.
        You find this last definition operative in the mid-market world of Starbucks and similar upscalish supermarket coffees.
        Here “house blend” seems to describe a blend brought to as little darker roast
        than a “breakfast blend” though not nearly as dark as blends labeled “espresso roast” or “French roast.”
        Finally, house blends, unique or not, are generally expected to offer value to the customer.
        The implication is, step back from the Kenyas and the fancy microlots and you can save a few bucks
        while still drinking a great coffee that everyone at the table will enjoy.

    <p>
        French roast is considered to be a double roast coffee.
        This is a category of dark roasted coffee characterized by an intense and smoky-sweet flavor,
        accompanied by a thin body and mouthfeel.

    <p>
        A cup of coffee can take you all the way around the world without leaving your home.
        Once you have dialed in your favorite way to brew coffee,
        the next step is often to explore different types of beans.
